/** Write / Read mecanism
 
	writeAs<Format> / readFrom<Format> methods are not directly called using the classic message system.
	We should prefer use one of the exported TT<Format>Reader / TT<Format>Writer method which have :
		- an Object attribute : the TTObject you want it reads / writes a file
	or
		- the data structure to pass in order to read / write depending on the selected <Format>
 
	This allow us to use the same method to start reading / writing and even to ask to other objects to
	read / write recursively on the same data stucture.
 
 
	Exemple :
 
	If you want to read in Opml format you set the Object attribute as myTopObject then you call the Read message with 
	aValueContainingFullPathToaFile. Then this method (as a friend of your TTTopObject class) will automatically create 
	an OpmlReader data structure and call ReadFromOpml(aValueContainingAnOpmlReader) on your myTopObject.
 
	Because your TTTopObject class used TTLowerObject to describe himself (and have to extract their opml description 
	from the opml file to set them up) the ReadFromOpml method sets recursively the Object Attribute with aLowerObject 
	and then calls the Read message with an empty value : this would calls the ReadFromOpml(aValueContainingAnOpmlReader)
	on your TTLowerObject.
